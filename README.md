My first app 🎉

Before I started making this app, I had already learned how to program in java ☕️, but I had no experience in android development at all. So I came up with some ideas for convenient and useful calculators 🧮 that I would use myself. Thus, working through them, I simultaneously learned how to write applications for android 🧠.

So, at that time, I already had the only java program that opened in a window , and not in the console ✍🏻, in which you could translate numbers into different number systems 🙂. 

Therefore, first of all, I decided to add this program to my application 💁‍♂️.
