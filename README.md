## Many years ago...

Before I started making this app, I had already learned how to program in java ☕️, but I had no experience in android development at all. So I came up with some ideas for convenient and useful calculators 🧮 that I would use myself. Thus, working through them, I simultaneously learned how to write applications for android 🧠.

So, at that time, I already had the only java program that opened in a window , and not in the console ✍🏻, in which you could translate numbers into different number systems 🙂.

Therefore, first of all, I decided to add this program to my application 💁‍♂️.
And here you can see how it looks like 👀:

## Old plans

But my main task at that time was to create a physical calculator, where you could enter all the values we know and get everything that could be calculated from it. It turned out to be a very difficult task 🥵, but after many sleepless nights, I finally managed to do it 💪.

In general, it turned out very well for a beginner, both in design and functionality. Of course, many things could have been done better, but I went further 🤟.




## What's next?

At first, I thought for a long time what else could be added to this application 🤔 and finally I came up with another idea 💡. We started to learn new topics in school about derived functions and functions with parameters 📈. So these 2 things became the next features of the Next app.
Thanks to the experience gained earlier, the implementation of this was not so difficult 🤓, but there were great difficulties with the implementation of function calculations. I eventually found the symja library for myself, as well as GraphView for working with MathJax 🤝.

And here's what finally happened 🤲:

At this moment, I decided to finish working on the project and put it on Google Play 🛒. Also, I initially added some ads to it 🤑, but then decided that it didn't make sense and turned it off 🤧.




## Total:
During the year of development, I got an incredible experience working on the project 👨🏻‍💻, I learned how to create my own applications completely from scratch and upload them to the Internet 🕸. Many of the similar applications on the Internet seemed to me rather nondescript and unattractive 😬, so during development I paid a lot of attention not only to the code itself, but also to the design, which would immediately draw the attention of a stranger to itself. 👨🏻‍🎨. As it seems to me, it turned out quite well, although even I will not be able to deal with that old code 😎. However, I took into account all the mistakes and did not repeat them in future projects 🥳
